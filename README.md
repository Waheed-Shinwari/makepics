# makepics
makepics is a light and simple tool to create pictures or images from a video file.
I buil this tool when I needed each and every frame from a video for another project, 
so that I could analyse those frames one by one.

The compiled binary file is included i.e makepics

Sample usage:

Usage: makepics [params] 

	-h, --help (value:true)
		show help message
	--path
		path of directory where to save the images/frames
	--type
		type of the images you want to save i.e jpg,jpeg,png etc
	--vid
		video file from which to extract images/frames

Example usage:
./makepics --path=./myDirectory/ --type=png --vid=myVideoFile.mp4
